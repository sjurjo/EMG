```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(readxl); library(tidyverse); library(biosignalEMG)

emg <- read_excel("./data/VLLtest3_20cyc.xlsx")

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r Change to EMG signal, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}

# Change emg to emg object
emg.x <- emg$VLL # 
plot(emg.x, channels = "all", samples = 0, type = "l",  timeunits = "seconds",
     add = FALSE)

length(emg.x)

emgraw <- as.emg(emg.x, samplingrate = 1500, units = "mV", date.name = "VLL") # sampling rate 1500Hz to avoid signal loss
is.emg(emgraw) # EMG object check
plot(emgraw)
emgraw #emg raw data


# High pass filter
x <- highpass(emgraw, cutoff = 20) # 20 Hz recommended for sport activities (maybe as much as 30 Hz)
emghpass <- rectification(x)

plot(x, main = "High pass filter")
plot(emghpass, main = "High pass filter with rectification")
emghpass #data with high pass filter and rectified

## Full-wave rectified EMG
emgrect <- rectification(emgraw, rtype = "fullwave", data.name = "VLL") 
plot(emgrect, main = "Rectified EMG")
emgrect # raw EMG data full-wave rectified

#EMG Moving average
emgrms <- envelope(emghpass, method = "MA", wsize = 100) # wsize; 100 ms, most common for all conditions
plot(emgrms, main = "MA-envelope")
emgrms

#EMG RMS (preferred recommendation for smoothing)
emgrms <- envelope(emgrect, method = "RMS", wsize = 100) # wsize; 100 ms, most common for all conditions
plot(emgrms, main = "RMS-envelope")
emgrms

### Active or passive phase

emgthr <- onoff_singlethres(emghpass, t = 90, data.name = "RMS")

plot(emghpass, main = "High pass filter with rectification")
plot(emgthr, type = "l", main = "Detected phases (single thresholding)")
emgthr # detecting active/passive phases

# Ensemble-averaged EMG
avgemg <- eaemg(emghpass, runs = emgthr, what = 1, timenormalization = "mean", scalem = 1, empirical = TRUE, level = 0.95)
avgemg
plot(avgemg, lwd = 1.5, main = "Ensemble-averaged EMG")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
